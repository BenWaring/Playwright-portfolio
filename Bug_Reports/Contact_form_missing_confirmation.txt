Bug #2:

Severity: Medium
Priority: Medium

Summary:
After submitting the contact form there is no visible indication of successful submission.

What is the expected results:
There should be a confirmation that the submission was correct.
(Something you would confirm with Product or Development)

Is there a suitable workaround?:
No - however this doesn't seem to break anything on the site and would be more a client side issue.

Repro Steps:
Go to the contact form on the front page
Enter the information into the contact form
Click submit
Observe no confirmation warning
